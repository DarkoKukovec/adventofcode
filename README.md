# [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)

## Chain all the things!!!

* Arrays + Lodash
* The solutions are not ment to be fast, DRY or too readable. It's supposed to be an experiment if all of the tasks can be solved like this

### Rules

* only input is the lodash object with task input
* no other dependencies (other than some very specific, e.g. md5)
* no variables & asignments
* no returns (except for the arrow function ones)

## Setup

    npm install

## Run

    npm start <day>

## Requirements

Node 4+ (Arrow functions, template strings)
